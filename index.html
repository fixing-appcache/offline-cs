      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this exercise is to gather raw material out of which to derive use cases and requirements, and ultimately, specifications and implementations. The case studies were collected during a meeting of developers closely related to the development of these applications were present. They were further expanded afterwards.</p>
      
      <p>These case studies describe the way, as of writing, different engineering teams have decided to handle the challenge of bringing application to work offline within the constraints of the currently deployed web platforms, their own business goals, etc. They are in no way to be interpreted as best practices.</p>

            * separate domain
            * not a retrofit, would have required a re-write anyway
            * want to provide a subset of overall content, scored by users a-priori
            * can't put a manifest on every page - lack of control, no way to uncache parts explicitly
             - diveintohtml5 pattern doesn't work; no way to expire things
             - bunfight over cache eviction policies
            * description of the problems: http://w   ww.alistapart.com/articles/application-cache-is-a-douchebag/
          * problem with stale data
          * problem with user-facing private data
          * wanted the app towork without JS
          * cached JSON data in localStorage (mustache to render HTML - reason is storing multiple page data)
            - unreliably connected is *worse* than disconnected
           • because users are logged in and their data is saved to the cache, if they log out and someone else logs in you get the wrong data. So they include the login as a comment in the manifest to work around that.
           • We use XHR just so we can show the "Loading" thing
           • there is no error feedback on fallback pages, and there are quite a few rather different error cases
           • interesting attack: load the main page with lots of different query strings, cause it to be implicitly cached many, many times
           • far-future caching of the manifest will lock out updates until the far future happens (Some small number of FT users still locked into an AppCache from July 2011)

        <h2>The Economist on PlayBook</h2>

        <p>The Economist HTML5 app is currently only available from <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/117808">BlackBerry App World</a> as a PlayBook app running under BlackBerry WebWorks (for the distribution channel, presence on home screen, removal of browser chrome), but since it does not use any of the WebWorks APIs, it does not rely on the WebWorks environment and can be viewed in a browser. Currently it requires JavaScript but only for layout assistance - if support for a fallback layout using only CSS were added, the app would work without JavaScript, and that remains a longer term aim. The app has the capability to render content server side and deliver combined content+structure responses partly in support of that goal, also partly for performance, and finally to enable crawler support.</p>

        <p>Building the app took advantage of lessons learned from the first generation of the FT web app. Some of the challenges and experiences in building the Economist app are discussed in the FT Labs blog posts listed in <a href="#the-economist-references" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

           * the result of lessons learned from the FT app
            * no manifest when uesrs aren't signed in
            * offline is an explicit uesr choice (users are prompted)
            * manifest is populated via an iframe, the same as Lanyrd
            * upon user permission, download all current edition to WebSQL/IndexedDB
            • we don't know how much space there is in appcache, and realistically we find that it usually is not enough for our needs
          * storing images as encoded strings in the db.
          * batching requests for pages. Pages are atomic, JSON data that contain the text content + the encoded images.
          * playbook app gone through the app world
           * economist has a native affordance, app store distribution
           * FT only run through web UI, but prompts users to add a web shortcut
             - shortcut is the preferred method for Lanyrd too
           * neither FT nor Lanyrd is mobile-only for this stuff, but is mobile-first
          * on desktop, one of the important use cases is to pre-fetch content.
           * individual issues tend not to change
             - eviction is handled through LocalStorage/etc., not through AppCache, and is LRU based on issues
           * All the JS is in LocalStorage
           • on startup, a heartbeat is sent to the server with last modificatin times of the resources in local storage
             - server responds with information about what to update (and the priority of the update) based on compat with currently bootstrapped host code
          * very long session times (sometimes weeks)
           * everyone is using window.name to hold invalidation/last-boot information in order to avoid reload loops and to force refreshes when the appcache has old templates vs. incompatible data
            * two fallbacks: /api and /issues, both  are needed to make JS apis work gracefully when things aren't working
          * want to support content + struc in the same response for performance reasons, crawlers, etc.
          * deliver content within the structure first (data inlcuded in HTML markup) then bootstap the JS ("appify"). 
           * origin segmentation is a huge issue. Everyone is checksumming in order to invalidate based on user of the app (different logins in the same browser/session)

        <h2>Mobile Facebook</h2>

        <p>The URL to the mobile Facebook website is: <a href="https://m.facebook.com">https://m.facebook.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Facebook experimented with using AppCache on its mobile website to improve performance by aggressively caching static assets in the face of limited HTTP cache support in mobile browsers, more specifically that of early iOS devices. This experiment was stopped in December 2011 as the results weren't showing significant performance improvements and added a lot of complexity. Because Facebook relies on a probabilistic packaging system to bundle resources, cached content gets invalidated on each push. Since pushes happen daily, AppCache ended up burning through too much network resources to be useful.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <!--
           * current infrastructure has oone giant branch system, no differentiation based on clinet capability in terms of overall architecture
           * 2011 Appcache testing - facebook is mainly content 
           * caching static resources via AppCache
           * push a lot, many invalidations, pre-fetching punishes demand-loading of content
           * history API via a controller that owns the app state
             - JS for page is serialized in sequence and replayed when view is returned to
           * always signed in (no way to cache the whole thing), never offline
           * appcache for perf *only*
           * would strongly prefer a "page state snapshotting" system
             - don't have a strong idea for how the controller would interact with this
           * NO LONGER USING APPCACHE
             - stopped in Dec
             - burned through too many network resources to be useful
             - probabilistic resource packaging means that all content is invalidated on each push
           * changing their appraoch, looking to be more in-line with AppCache's current strenghts
             - will go to a more app-like style, which will help
             - progressive enhancement to the Nth degree is untennable at some size
             - spreading a codebase too wide hurts both high and low-end experiences
           * concern that relying on HTTP for *SOME* things, *PART* of the time makes the whole system extremely difficult to reason about (see: no store headers and master entries vs. other items)
           * big apps hit the "manifests hosted on diffrent servers from data and load-balancer's f you" and invalidating everything is the only way to go because you can't do temp responses (because spec doesn't want to be hostage to captive portals)
             - manifest on Server 1, downloads master entry (which can't be fingerprinted)
             - resources are on a CDN and are all fingerprinted
             ... much quibbling over what spec actually says about 2-phase update...
             ... some discussion of overlapping resource requests in disjoint manifests from the same domain ...
          NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THE MANIFEST SELECTION ALGORITHM

          ... correction... 

          WE HAVE NO MENTAL MODEL FOR APPCACHE, and as a group are relatively convinced that nobody else does either.

        <h2>Mobile GMail</h2>

        <p>The URL to Mobile GMail is: <a href="https://m.gmail.com">https://m.gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <p>GMail has very little public data - almost everything is user specific. The site is always served over SSL. There are many different versions of GMail for different platforms and client capabilities. Variation is mostly done server side. Gears <!--
          TODO Add link to GEARS
        --> was designed to make GMail work offline, and consequently Google has been keen to get the main features of Gears into HTML5. Offline use is only supported on the most modern browsers, where app cache is used to store the 'shell' of the application, though not the application code. Like the Economist app, the main app code is stored in localStorage. The code is initially delivered as comments inside the HTML document, so it only need be parsed when actually required. Performance targets are time to inbox and time to first message, so being able to parse and/or update only specific code is important. AppCache contains just a fallback for bootstrapping the app while offline.</p>

        <p>Every view of GMail is a search, the most common and default one being a search that produces what the UI refers to as the inbox (the inbox exists in practice only in the sense that some messages are tagged with an inbox tag so that they can be found by that search)</p>
        
        <!--
